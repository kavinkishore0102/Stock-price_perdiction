Stock price prediction leverages historical financial data and machine learning algorithms, like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to forecast future stock prices.
Stock price prediction is a crucial aspect of financial analysis that involves forecasting future stock prices based on historical data and various analytical techniques. This process utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which are well-suited for time-series data due to their ability to retain information from previous inputs. By analyzing historical stock prices and other relevant financial indicators, these models can detect patterns and trends that inform future price movements.

The prediction process typically starts with data collection, where historical stock prices and additional economic indicators are gathered. This data is then cleaned and normalized to ensure accuracy and split into training and testing sets. The RNN model is trained on the historical data using techniques like backpropagation through time to minimize prediction errors. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, and the trained model is then used to forecast future stock prices.
